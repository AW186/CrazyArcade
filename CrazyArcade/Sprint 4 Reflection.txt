Sprint Reflection for Sprint 4

	Overall the main takeaway from Sprint 4 that the group came to was that group members
as a whole waited too long to take care of their tasks. While the group started out earlier
in the week when compared to other sprints, many of the tasks that were assigned were taken
care of on the last couple of days. One of the key factors that was pointed out was that
when pull requests were made, they were sometiles left without any activity for a couple of days
before it was merged or had sufficient changes made. One key change that will be made is the 
promptness of reviewing pull requests, so that forward progress will always be made.

	In regard to task tracking, the group has seen improvement in better defining tasks into
smaller categories, as well as making them towards the begining of the sprint instead of all
at the end. 

	When looking at a burndown chart representation of the sprint, one key thing to note is
that not all tasks when completed were marked as such. This is an issue that will be worked on
in the final sprint, as it becomes harder to see the progress if tasks are not marked as
completed when they are. That being said, when considering the actual order in which tasks
were finished, many were completed on the final day.
