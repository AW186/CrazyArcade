Sprint 5 Reflection - Crazy Arcade Team

	Overall on Sprint 5, the team preformed better than it had on any previous sprint. One of
the main changes that were made following sprint 4 was the more even workload that the team
gave itself, instead of crunching hard during the last week the team worked much more evenly
throughout all three of the weeks.
	The first priority that the team gave itself was to clean up all of the bugs left from
Sprint 4 that could not be completed in time. This was done during the planning stages of the
first week. In the first week, the team also started to think of features that could reasonably
be added in the time of spring 5. As soon as the proposed features were given the O.K. the second
and third weeks of the sprint were spent working towards completing the features. Another change
that was made from Sprint 4 was increase of frequency of meetings that were had. Instead of one 
in person meeting every week, 2-3 smaller meetings were held online. In these meetings pull requests
were reviewed and merged, so there were no dates in which large number of pull requests were reviewed
en mass.
	Another key change that was made to the way the group functioned was the decidely smaller pull
requests that were made. This allowed for smaller scale issues to be tackeled and code reviewed easier
without needing commit as much time to read a massive suite of changes.
	Looking at a burndown chart representation of the project, the dates in which the issues were closed
seem like they heavily clump up on a couple different key days, however this was due to the issues being
closed in the project and the issue itself. Despite this, it is clear that despite issues being marked as
completed all at once, work was still steadily being done.
