How to play:
		The player starts each level with no power ups. Over the corse of each level, collect power ups
	by destroying some blocks and defeat each enemy for them to drop a key. Pick up a key to advance 
	to the next level by walking through the door. Sometimes a key will already be in a level, picking
	it up will still unlock the door. Defeating the Sun Boss will unlock the door without dropping a key.
	Be careful of the pirate, he can drop bombs and pick up powerups just like the player.
		Getting hit by an enemy or by a bomb explosion will put the player in a bubble. If it pops,
	the player will lose a life. If the player loses all lives, the game will end.
		At the end of each level, the player will get another life, another shield and needle item, and
	gain 100 points.

Tools Used:
	-Code metrics were again used, one being generated on 12/2. This was used to see how much more complicated
	the project was from sprint 4, and to see if there were any files that were much too complex for their purpose.
